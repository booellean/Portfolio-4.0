This banner is designed to illustrate my love for programming and my love for the aesthetic arts. Because I have trouble with "technical" shapes by nature, I made this image by first taking a picture of a tree, masking it to a high contrast black and white format, and then using Photoshop's mosaic filter to "pixelate" the image. By having black and white sections to visualize, I was then able to see the composition I was looking for. Each shape and line was made indivudally using Adobe Illustrator, and ultimately the composition, space, and color balance are all made to direct your eyes to a small heart-shaped object in the lower left hand corner.`,

Water is central to the health and wellness of many Pacific Northwest tribes and was often used to symbolize wealth(although not monetary) in narratives. The second is Komokwa who was known as "copper-maker". His domain was underseas, and those who were able to reach it were rewarded with wealth and spirit magic.
