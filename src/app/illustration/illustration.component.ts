    description: `A study of an elderly woman's face, this was in response to the fear of aging and death after a series of severe panic attacks. Part of the purpose of this study was to find a peace in absence, the void, or whatever it is that follows us after we die. The somewhat relaxed strain on the figure's face is reminiscent of the face my grandmother held after her passing. The colorful strokes that meld into her hair spiral and wave into unknown territory. All of this while the colors contrast one another in warmth and coolness`,
